# A simple implementation of persistent homology in Rust

This repository contains an implementation of matrix reduction and persistence pairing algorithm for Z2 persistent homology groups.
The algorithm is proposed by Cohen-Steiner et al. in [http://www.mrzv.org/publications/vineyards/](http://www.mrzv.org/publications/vineyards/).

This implementation is written for my study and I will rewrite it.
